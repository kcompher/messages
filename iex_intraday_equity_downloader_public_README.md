iex_intraday_equity_downloader
==============================

Python scripts to automate the download and storage process of iex equity data in parquet format.

## Some Notes:

The task scheduler used is `crontab` which is available on linux systems. An example list of `crontab` tasks is located in `./src/data/iex_cronjob.txt`. If you use a different OS you will have to create your own scheduler to run the scripts. 

You will also have to go to `./src/data/*` and update each python script with your local project directory.

To run these scripts requires some additional dependencies:

- [tzlocal](https://github.com/regebro/tzlocal)
- [pandas_market_calendars](https://github.com/rsheftel/pandas_market_calendars)
- [pyarrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/python)
- [fastparquet](https://github.com/dask/fastparquet/)
